\chapter{Standard Model}

%Brief history 

% particle physics begun with discovery of the electron

%for the next 50 years new particles continued to be discovered mostly from cosmic ray experiments

%blossomed after 1950 discovery of new elementtary particles which lead to the and the development of high energy particle accelerators to provide controlled beams of known energy. This lead to the 
% discovery of the quark substructure of matter and the beginings of the standard model
\section{Constituents of the Standard Model}
With only a few exceptions, all results from high energy physics experiments can
be explained within the Standard Model of particles and their interactions.

\subsection{Fermions}
Within the standard model all matter is formed from spin $\nicefrac{1}{2}$
particles called fermions.
These comprise 6 leptons and 6 quarks, both split in to three generations.

Leptons are particles with integer charge and are summarised in \TableRef{}. The
electon, muon and tau each have unit charge, where as the corresponding
neutrinos are neutral.

Quarks carry fractional charges of $\nicefrac{2}{3}$ and $\nicefrac{-1}{3}$

The electron, muon and tau each carry unit negative charge. 

Each charged lepton has a neutral partner called the neutrino.
