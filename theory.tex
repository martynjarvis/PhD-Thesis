%Brief history 

\section{Constituents of the Standard Model}
With only a few exceptions, all results from high energy physics experiments can
be explained within the Standard Model of particles and their interactions.

\subsection{Fermions}
Within the standard model all matter is formed from spin $\nicefrac{1}{2}$
particles called fermions.  These comprise 6 leptons and 6 quarks, both split in
to three generations.

Leptons are particles with integer charge and are summarised in \TableRef{}. The
electon, muon and tau each have unit charge, where as the corresponding
neutrinos are neutral. 

Quarks carry fractional charges of $\nicefrac{2}{3}$ and $\nicefrac{-1}{3}$ and
are summarised in \TableRef{}.

The electron, muon and tau each carry unit negative charge. 

Each charged lepton has a neutral partner called the neutrino.
