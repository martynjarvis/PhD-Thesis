The electron charge asymmetry in inclusive \PW production has been measured
using an initial data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
\unit{36}{\invpb} of data and updated with a larger data sample corresponding to
an integrated luminosity of \unit{840}{\invpb}.

The measurement has been performed with a template fitting method to the \ETm
spectrum of events selected using a simple cut based electron selection.
The backgrounds have been modelled using control regions obtained with an
inverted selection for the QCD contribution, as well as Monte Carlo simulations
for the better understood background contributions.
The signal has been modelled using a MC simulation corrected with a data-driven
boson recoil method.
The measurement was presented in bins of pseudorapidity. In the first
measurement 5 bins were used and in the updated measurement the additional
statistics available allowed the results to be presented in 11 bins.
The results have been compared directly to predictions based on several PDF
models. 

The measurement of the electron charge asymmetry with
\unit{36}{\invpb} of CMS data\cite{baisini2010electron} was combined with a
similar measurement in the muon channel\cite{majumder2010muon} and published
together\cite{asym36}.  The combined electron and muon asymmetry measurement is
shown in \FigureRef{fig:combined}. The electron and muon measurements are in
good agreement with each other.

In addition to the CMS measurements, similar charge asymmetry measurements were
made with the LHCb and the ATLAS experiments. The combined results, in the muon
channels, over a combined pseudorapidity range of $0.0 < |\eta | < 4.0$, are
shown in \FigureRef{fig:ex_combined}.

The precise measurement of the asymmetry in inclusive \PW production at the LHC
provides constraints for parton distribution functions \cite{asym840}.  For
example, the NNPDF collaboration \cite{Lionetti:2011pw} have studied the impact
of the 2010 LHC \PW lepton charge asymmetry data on their PDF sets\cite{Ball:2011gg}.
\FigureRef{fig:effect} shows a comparison of the up and down quark and
anti-quark distributions before and after the combined LHC data have been
added\cite{Ball:2011gg}.  The lepton asymmetry measurements reduce the PDF
uncertainties of the light quarks. This was the first use of LHC data in
the production of PDF sets.

The updated measurement of the electron charge asymmetry with an integrated
luminosity of \unit{840}{\invpb} has also been used by PDF collaborations to
examine the behaviour of their PDFs.  The results continued to show some
disagreement with the predictions generated using PDFs from the MSTW
collaboration.  The MSTW collaboration examined this in more
detail\cite{martin2013extended}, and saw that by extending their
parametrisation the agreement with the CMS asymmetry data can be significantly
improved as shown in \FigureRef{fig:mstwimprovement}.

The measurements of the electron charge asymmetry are important inputs in to
the global fits that are used to constrain the PDFs. Improved knowledge on PDFs
has an impact on almost all measurements and searches that are performed at high
energy hadron colliders.
