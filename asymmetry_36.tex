\chapter{ 
Measurement of the electron charge asymmetry with \unit{36}{\invpb} }


In this chapter the first measurement of the electron charge asymmetry in
inclusive \inclusiveWe production with the CMS detecotr is described.

The analysis is performed on the full 2010 dataset, which corresponds to a
luminosity of \unit{36.1}{\invpb}.

\section{Event Selection}

The event selection used in this analysis is based on a limited number of cuts.
This is due to the limited statistics available in early data taking.

\subsection{Trigger}

Several triggers were used to select the events, due to the increasing
luminosity in the LHC 2010 run.

In the initial runs, events were selected using only a single photon trigger. 
As the luminosity increased these triggers became prescaled it was
necessary to use electron triggers to select events. 
As the luminosity increased even further, it was necesary to use electron
triggers that included cuts on electron ID variables.

\subsection{Electron Selection}

The available unprescaled triggers constrain the electron momentum to be above
\unit{25}{\GeV}.

Electrons candidates are identified using a cut based approach on an limited
number of variables.

\subsection{Event Selection}

An Event is selected if if contains a single electron that passes all electron
selection.
To removed Drell-Yan events an event is vetoed if it contasins a second lepton
(an electron passing a loose selecton, or an isolated muon) with $\pt > 
\unit{15}{\GeV}$

The Particle Flow \ETm distribution for the events that pass the event
selection, with $\pt > \unit{25}{\GeV}$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$ is shown in
\fig{asym36:pfmet}.
The number of selected events that pass the event selection, binned in charge 
and eta, are shown in \tab{asym36:selectedevents}.

\section{Signal Yield Extraction}

The number of signal and background events in each bin is extracted using a fit
to the \ETm distribution using two templates.
The first is the sum of the \Wenu signal and the \EWK background shapes,
and the second is the sum of the \QCD plus \gjet processes.

\subsection{\QCD \ETm Shape}

The \QCD and \gjet background distribution is obtained from a control sample of
events. The control sample is selected by requiring that the electrons pass the
isolation and H over E cuts but fail the $\Delta\phi$ and $\Delta\eta$ cuts as
shown in \tab{asym36:antisel}.
