\chapter{W Bosons at the LHC}

\section{Introduction}

\PW boson production is an important process for physics studies at the LHC.

At the \ac{LHC}, \PW bosons are produced at a high rate while offering a clean
experimental signal with a final state consisting of, in the case of a
leptonically decaying \PW, a single high \PT lepton with a large ammount of
missing transverse energy due to the neutrino in the event.

\PW provide an important test of the \ac{SM} and accurate measurements of the
\ac{SM} parameters. 

The production of \PW, through the \ac{DY} process, provides important
information on the interacting partons within the colliding hadrons.

\section{W Boson Production}

The dominant production process for a \PW boson at a hadron-hadron collider is
shown in \EquationRef{wbos:dyproc}

\begin{equation}
  h_1(P_1) + h_2(P_2)
  \to 
  \PW + X
  \to
  \Pe \Pnue + X
  \label{wbos:dyproc}
\end{equation}

The \PW boson is produced by the collision of the two incoming hadrons $h_1$
and $h_2$ with momenta $p_1$ and $p_2$. The \PW then decays leptonically to an
electron and its corresonding neutrino. $X$ represents the accompanying final
state.

The differential crossection at a fixed rapidity of the \PW boson is denoted by
$\nicefrac{d\sigma_{(\HepProcess{h_1 h_2 \to \PWpm}})}{dy_W}$ where $y_W$ is
the rapidity of the \PW boson. 
At hadron colliders the full cross section is a convolution of the crosssection
at the parton level, and the \acp{PDF}.

\begin{multline}
  d\sigma_{(\HepProcess{h_1 h_2 \to \PWpm})}(p_1,p_2) = \\
  \sum\limits_{a,b}
  \int_0^1 \! \mathrm{d} x_1 
  \int_0^1 \! \mathrm{d} x_2 
  f_a^{h_1}(x_1,Q^2)
  f_b^{h_2}(x_2,Q^2) 
  d\hat{\sigma}_{(\HepProcess{a b \to \PWpm})}(x_1 p_1, x_2 p_2; Q^2)
  \label{wbos:xsec}
\end{multline}

where $\sum\limits_{a,b}$ represents the sum over the initial parton states $a$
and $b$, $f_a^{h}(x,Q^2)$ represents the \acp{PDF} and
$d\hat{\sigma}_{(\HepProcess{a b \to \PWpm})}(x_1 p_1, x_2 p_2; Q^2)$
represents the partonic sub-process crosssection.

\subsection{Partonic Sub-Process}

At \ac{LO} the process for a \PWp is
\begin{equation}
  \HepProcess{\Pup + \APdown \to \PWp \to \Pleptonplus \Pnulepton} \label{wbos:wprod} \\
\end{equation}
and for a \PWm:
\begin{equation}
  \HepProcess{\APup + \Pdown \to \PWm \to \Pleptonminus \APnulepton}
\end{equation}

A tree-level feynman diagram representing this process is shown in
\FigureRef{wbos:feynman}.

%At the Tevatron (a proton-antiproton collider) the two incoming partons, $a$ and $b$, are most likely to be valence
%quarks from the proton and antiproton respectivly. Therefore, previous studys
%of the \PW boson at the Tevatron have been mostly sensative to the valence
%quarks of the proton.

At the \ac{LHC} (a proton-proton collider), one parton is most likely be a
valence quark with a high fraction of the protons momentum, and the other
parton will tend to be a sea anti-quark with a lower fraction of the momentum
than the quark. This causes the \PW bosons to tend to be produced at higher
rapidities than at the Tevatron (a proton-antiproton collider) where the two
incoming partons are most likely to be valence quarks from the proton and
antiproton respectivly.

It follows from \EquationRef{wbos:prod} that and difference in distributions of
the $\Pup$ and $\Pdown$ quarks or the $\APup$ and $\APdown$ anti-quarks will
cause the cross-section for \PWp and \PWm production to differ.

%A measurement of
%the distribution of the \PW bosons rapidities at the \ac{LHC} provides direct
%information on the quark and anti-quark densities of the proton at a high scale
%and low values of the parton momentum fraction. 

\subsection{\acp{PDF}} 
The \ac{PDF} represents the number density of parton $a$ that has a momentum
fraction $x+\mathrm{d}x$ of the colliding hadron $h$.  \acp{PDF} are obtained
from global fits to experimental data. %TODO more?

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  %\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{placeholder}
  \caption{Proton PDF at $Q^2\approx M_{\PW}^2$.}
  \label{wbos:pdf}
\end{figure}

\FigureRef{wbos:pdf} shows the proton PDF at $Q^2\approx M_{\PW}^2$. 

\subsection{Asymmetric \PW boson Production} 
The \ac{PDF} for the valence quarks in the proton differ, the up-type quark
dominates over the down-type, mainly due to the valence quark content of the
proton (\HepProcess{\Pup\Pup\Pdown}). 

The ratio of the up-type and the down-type \acp{PDF}, $R_{ud}(x.Q^2)$, is given
by:

\begin{equation}
  R_{ud}(x.Q^2) = \frac{\Pup(x.Q^2)}{ \Pdown(x.Q^2)} > 1
\end{equation}

Where $\Pup(x.Q^2)$ are the up and down quark \acp{PDF}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  %\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{placeholder}
  \caption{The ratio of up-type and the down-type \acp{PDF}, $R_{ud}(x.Q^2)$,
  in the proton at $Q^2\approx M_{\PW}^2$.}
  \label{wbos:pdfrat}
\end{figure}

\FigureRef{wbos:pdfrat} shows the ratio of up-type and the down-type \acp{PDF},
$R_{ud}(x.Q^2)$, in the proton at $Q^2\approx M_{\PW}^2$. 
The ratio $R$ is a function of $x$, $R \approx 1$ for $x<<1$ and increases
monotonically as $x$ increases.  
This is due to \Pup quarks tending to carry a greater fraction of the protons
momentum, $x$, than the \Pdown type quarks.
% TODO why?

%This causes the \PWp to be produced at a greater rate and at a larger rapidity, where as the \PWm
%will tend to be produced less and more centrally. 

The difference in distributions of the $\Pup$ and $\Pdown$ quarks cause the
cross-section for \PWp and \PWm production to differ as a function of the boson
rapidity.

Therefore a measurement of the asymmetric production of \PW bosons, as a
function of the rapidity of the boson, at the \ac{LHC} provides important
information on the ratio of the up-type and down-type quark parton densities ,
$R_{ud}(x.Q^2)$, within the proton. 

%\section{W Charge Asymmetry}

%A particularly interesting observable involving \PW bosons produced in hadron
%collisions is an asymmetry in the production of \PWp and \PWm bosons as a
%function of rapidity.
%In proton-antiproton colliders, such as Fermilab's Tevatron,  \PWp and \PWm
%bosons are produced at equal rates but \PWp are produced more in the direction
%on the incoming proton where as the \PWm are produced more in the opposite
%direction.
%In proton-proton colliders, such as the LHC, the \PWp is produced in greater
%rates than the \PWm. Additionally the \PWp are produced at larger rapidities
%where as the \PWm bosons are produced more centrally. \cite{phenom}

%The difference in production rate of \PWpm boson is mainly due to the quark
%content in the proton and the rapidity dependence is due to the \Pup quarks on
%average carrying a greater fraction of the proton momentum that \Pdown quarks.
%Therefore a measurement of the charge asymmetry can provide important
%information on the parton density functions of the proton.\cite{phenom,pdf}.

%At the LHC it has been proposed \cite{kom} that an asymmetry measurement could
%also be used to measure the contribution of New Physics, since in the Standard
%Model, \begin{equation}
%\sigma_{SM}(\PWp + jets) \approx 1.3 \times \sigma_{SM}(\PWm + jets)
%\end{equation}
%where as typically in many New Physics theories and models predict
%\begin{equation}
%\sigma_{NP}(\PWp + jets) = \sigma_{NP}(\PWm + jets)
%\end{equation}
%examples include the pair production of gluinos in supersymmetry where the
%gluinos decay to one charged lepton, missing energy and jets.\cite{kom}

\section{Electron Charge Asymmetry}
% formalised def of w asymmetry

% explanation of why this can't be done, W rapidity

\PW bosons are identified by their decay to a lepton plus neutrino, however at
hadronic colliders the neutrino longitudinal momentum is unmeasured meaning
that the \PW rapidity is unknown. Instead what is studied is the lepton charge
asymmetry.

% explain that it is convolution(?) of W production, and well understood parity
% violating decay of the W boson

\cite{phenom} The theoretical asymmetry is given by equation
\ref{eq:AsymThe}.

\begin{equation}
A_{the}(\eta)=\frac{  \frac{d\sigma}{d\eta}(\Wpenu) -
\frac{d\sigma}{d\eta}(\Wmenu) }{ \frac{d\sigma}{d\eta}(\Wpenu) +
\frac{d\sigma}{d\eta}(\Wmenu) }
\label{eq:AsymThe}
\end{equation} 

The experimentally measured asymmetry is given by equation
\ref{eq:AsymExp}.\cite{kom}
 
\begin{equation}
A_{exp}(\eta)=\frac{  \frac{dN}{d\eta}(\Pelectron) -
\frac{dN}{d\eta}(\APelectron) }{ \frac{dN}{d\eta}(\Pelectron) +
\frac{dN}{d\eta}(\APelectron) }
\label{eq:AsymExp}
\end{equation} 

The two measurements are related by equation \ref{eq:NumEve} which takes in to
account the experimental effects such as the luminosity (${\cal L}$), high
level trigger ($\epsilon_{HLT}$), offline efficiency ($ \epsilon_{off}$) and
the acceptance ($\epsilon_{acc}$).

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{d\eta} = {\cal L } \frac{d\sigma}{d\eta}  \epsilon_{HLT}
\epsilon_{off} \epsilon_{acc}
\label{eq:NumEve}
\end{equation} 

Since the asymmetry is a ratio, the luminosity high level trigger and the
offline efficiency cancel.\cite{me} The acceptance can not be cancelled
however, since it is a function of rapidity and momentum and electrons and
positrons will have different rapidity and momentum distributions. The
experimentally measured asymmetry can therefore be related to the theoretical
asymmetry by correcting for the acceptance.\cite{me}

\begin{align} 
A_{exp}(\eta) &= \frac{ \frac{dN}{d\eta}(\Pelectron) -
\frac{dN}{d\eta}(\APelectron) }{ \frac{dN}{d\eta}(\Pelectron) +
\frac{dN}{d\eta}(\APelectron) }\\   
              &= \frac{ \frac{d\sigma}{d\eta}(\Wpenu) -
\frac{\epsilon^{-}_{acc}}{\epsilon^{+}_{acc}} \frac{d\sigma}{d\eta}(\Wmenu) }{
\frac{d\sigma}{d\eta}(\Wpenu) + \frac{\epsilon^{-}_{acc}}{\epsilon^{+}_{acc}}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\eta}(\Wmenu) }
\label{eq:AsymExpCorr}
\end{align}


%TODO, theoretical predictions?
