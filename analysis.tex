\chapter[Measurement of the Electron Charge Asymmetry]{Measurement of the Electron Charge Asymmetry with \unit{36}{\invpb} }
\label{chap:analysis}

In this chapter the measurement of the electron charge asymmetry is presented.
The analysis is performed on the full 2010 dataset, which corresponds to a
luminosity of \unit{36.1}{\invpb} at $\sqrtS = \unit{7}{\TeV}$
\cite{asym36,baisini2010electron}.

The results are presented in 6 bins of absolute value of pseudorapidity with a
fixed width of 0.4. To avoid the gap between the ECAL barrel and the ECAL endcap the
region $1.4<|\eta|<1.6$ is excluded.

\section{Event Selection}

The event selection is performed on single electron datasets formed of events
that are selected using various single photon and single electron triggers. From
these datasets, electrons are selected that pass a limited number of cuts.
Events that contain only a single electron are then selected for the analysis.

\subsection{Trigger}
\label{sec:trigger1}

Several high-level triggers (HLT) were used to select the events due to the
increasing luminosity during the {LHC} 2010 run.  In the initial runs, events
were selected using only a single photon trigger.  As the instantaneous
luminosity was increased and these triggers became prescaled, it was necessary
to use electron triggers to select events.  As the luminosity increased even
further, it was necessary to use electron triggers that included cuts on certain
electron ID variables.

In the following analysis, a control region is obtained by inverting the
selection on the $\Delta\phi$ and $\Delta\eta$ variables (see
\SectionRef{sec:eid}).
To ensure that this inverted selection is effective and will actually
select events, it is necessary to avoid using triggers that apply a selection on
these variables.

The triggers used to select the events are summarised in \TableRef{tab:triggers}
where ``HLT\_Ele$X$'' indicates a high-level trigger selection requiring an
electron with  $\Pt > \unit{X}{\GeV}$.  ``Photon'' in the name indicates that
the selection was applied to ECAL superclusters rather than a reconstructed
electron.  ``SW'' stands for small window, where window refers to the electron
pixel-matching window.  ``Cleaned'' indicates that spikes in the {ECAL} have
been removed.  

``CaloEleId'' and ``TighterCaloIdIso'' represent increasingly tighter selection
based on the shower shape ID and isolation variables from only the {ECAL},
and not the $\Delta\phi$ or $\Delta\eta$ variables.  


``TightEleId'' indicates a tight selection based on all ID variables. 
This nullifies the inverted cuts used for the control region but
it was the only trigger available for these runs without a prescale applied.
To compensate for the missing events in the control region, a looser prescaled
trigger was also applied in these runs.

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{The triggers used to select the data used in this analysis.}
  \label{tab:triggers}
\end{table}

\subsection{Electron Selection}
The available high-level triggers place a lower limit on the electron \pT
threshold.
To avoid a changing HLT efficiency caused by the trigger-turn-on efficiency
curve the electron \PT is required to be
greater than \unit{25}{\GeV} in the analysis. 
The results are presented with an electron \pT cut of 25, 30
and \unit{35}{\GeV}. 

Electron candidates are identified using a cut-based approach on a limited
number of variables \cite{daskalakis2009data}.  The cut values used correspond
to the $80\%$ working point from \TableRef{tab:electronwp}, and are summarised
again in \TableRef{tab:electronselection}. The $80\%$ working point was chosen
as a compromise between ensuring high-enough statistical accuracy while maintaining
a high-enough purity of the sample.

\end{table}

Incorrectly assigning the charge of an electron will lead to a dilution of the
measured charge asymmetry.  An additional requirement is applied to the charge
of the reconstructed electron to reject events where the true charge is
difficult to determine.  The methods for assigning a charge to an electron are
described in \SectionRef{sec:charge}. The methods are based on the GSF electron
charge, the general track charge and the supercluster charge.
Electron candidates are only selected if all of the three methods agree on the
charge assignment.

The incorrect charge assignment rate can be measured at the Z peak by comparing
the same sign \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pepm\Pepm} yield to the opposite sign
\HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pelectron\APelectron} yield. \FigureRef{fig:zpeak} show these
Z yields using only the {GSF} track charge (red) and also requiring a unanimous
assignment of charge from all three methods (blue). 

The incorrect charge assignment rate from the GSF track charge alone is about
$3\%$.  By requiring that all three methods for assigning the charge agree, and
vetoing events otherwise, the incorrect assignment rate can be reduced by a
factor of 8 with only a $5\%$ loss in efficiency \cite{baisini2010electron}.

radiation less than 0.3; the second electron is required only to pass the

\end{figure}

\subsection{Event Selection}
An event is selected if it contains a single electron that passes all the
electron selection requirements.  To remove Drell-Yan events, an event is vetoed
if it contains a second electron passing a loose selection with $\PT >
\unit{15}{\GeV}$.  Events are also vetoed if they contain an isolated muon with
$\PT > \unit{15}{\GeV}$.

The expected composition of the selected events is measured from the MC
simulation samples, With a \pT cut of \unit{25}{\GeV} it is expected that $65\%$
of selected events are signal events, and of the remaining $35\%$ background
events, the majority are from {QCD} backgrounds with a small number from
{electroweak} processes, which are mostly Drell-Yan (DY) events.

The particle flow \ETm distribution for the events that pass the event
selection, with an electron cut of $\PT > \unit{25}{\GeV}$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$ is
shown in \FigureRef{fig:pfmet_dist_36}. There are two obvious peaks in the
distribution. The peak at $\ETm \approx \unit{40}{\GeV}$ is the
\HepProcess{\PW\to\Pe\Pnue} signal region. This region also contains
\HepProcess{\PW\to\Ptau\Pnut} backgrounds. The peak at
$\ETm\approx \unit{10}{\GeV}$ is the background region that contains the {QCD}
and {DY} background events.

\section{Signal Yield Extraction Method}
The number of signal and background events in each bin is extracted using a
maximum likelihood fit to the \ETm distribution using two fixed templates shapes
\cite{adam2007towards}, similar to the method used in the measurement of the \PW
cross section \cite{alcaraz2010updated}.
The first template is the sum of the \Wenu signal and the {electroweak}
background shapes, and the second template is the sum of the {QCD} plus \gjet
processes.

\subsection{{QCD} \ETm Shape}
The \ETm distribution for the {QCD} and \gjet background is obtained from a control.
The control sample is selected by requiring that the electrons pass the
isolation and $H/E$ cuts but fail the $\Delta\phi$ and $\Delta\eta$ cuts as
shown in \TableRef{tab:antisel}.

To validate the anti-selection used, {QCD} Monte Carlo (MC) simulation samples are used. The
distribution of {QCD} MC events passing the event selection is compared to the
anti-selected MC events. This is shown for each pseudorapidity bin in
\FigureRef{tab:antiselclosure}. The agreement is seen to be good with little
signal contamination in the control region.

\subsection{Signal \ETm Shape from Boson Recoil}
\label{sec:recoil}
The \ETm in signal events arises from the unmeasured neutrino in the event. 
The signal \ETm shape is derived from MC simulations with an event-by-event
correction applied to account for differences in the \ETm scale and resolution
between data and MC.
The correction is based on the hadronic recoil distribution measured in data.
The recoil response and resolution in \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Plepton\Plepton} data
events is measured as a function of the \pT of the boson. This is combined with
information from the \PW and \PZ MC simulation to derive a correction to
the simulated \ETm as a function of \PW boson's \pT
\cite{bauer2010modeling,alcaraz2010updated}.

The transverse recoil vector, $\vec{U}$, is calculated from the reconstructed
transverse missing energy, $\vec{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$, and the
electron \pT vectors,
\begin{align}
\vec{U} &= - \vec{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}} 
      - \vec{p}^{\ \mathrm{e}}_{\mathrm{T}}\\
\vec{U} &= - \vec{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}} 
      - \sum_i \vec{p}^{\ \mathrm{e}_i}_{\mathrm{T}}
\end{align}
for \PW events and \PZ events respectively. $\vec{U}$ is split into components
that are parallel ($U_1$) and perpendicular ($U_2$) to the true boson \pT
direction. 
In \PZ data events the true boson \pT is not known and is reconstructed from the
\pT of the two electrons.

The hadronic activity that balances the \pT of the boson will lie mostly in the
$U_1$ direction whereas $U_2$ will be mostly formed from other sources.
\FigureRef{fig:recoil} shows the decomposition of $\vec{U}$ into $U_1$ and
$U_2$ in W events \cite{bauer2010modeling}.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=0.85\textwidth]{recoil}
    \caption[The decomposition of $\vec{U}$ for \PW events.] {The decomposition
of $\vec{U}$ for \PW events. Modified from \cite{bauer2010modeling}.}
    \label{fig:recoil}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

$U_1$ and $U_2$ are measured in \PZ data, \PZ MC simulation and \PW MC
simulation and are then binned in units of the boson \pT.  In each $p_T^{Z}$ bin
the $U_1$ and $U_2$ distributions are fitted with a Gaussian.  A linear function,
$f_i(p_T^Z)$, is fit to the distribution of the Gaussian means to produce a
response curve for both data and MC.  A second order polynomial,
$\sigma_i(p_T^Z)$, is then fit to the distribution of the Gaussian widths to
produce a resolution curve for both data and MC\cite{bauer2010modeling}.

The fitting procedure results in two response functions, $f_i(p_T)$, and two
resolution functions, $\sigma_i(p_T)$, for \PZ data, \PZ MC events and
the \PW MC events. The functions are then used to define a set of \PW
MC corrected functions, 

\begin{align}
f^{corr}_i (p^{W}_T)      
  &= \frac{ f^{Z\ data}_i (p^{Z}_T) }
          { f^{Z\ MC}_i (p^{Z}_T) }
          f^{W\ MC}_i (p^{W}_T) \\
\sigma^{corr}_i (p^{W}_T) 
  &= \frac{ \sigma^{Z\ data}_i (p^{Z}_T) }
          { \sigma^{Z\ MC}_i (p^{Z}_T) }
          \sigma^{W\ MC}_i (p^{W}_T) 
\end{align}

The corrected recoil response and resolution curves are then used to correct the
\PW MC \ETm. For each \PW MC event, the generator level \pT of the boson is
found, and the values for the response, $f^{corr}_i (p^{W}_T)$, and
resolution curves, $\sigma^{corr}_i (p^{W}_T) $, are looked up. A Gaussian is
defined with these values and then sampled to determine the new recoil
components $U_i$,
\begin{equation}
U_i \sim Gaus(f^{corr}_i (p^{W}_T), \sigma^{corr}_i (p^{W}_T) ).
\end{equation}
The components are then combined to form the new corrected recoil vector
$\vec{U^{\prime}}$ which is then combined with the electron vector to
form the corrected \ETm\cite{bauer2010modeling}.

The modelling of the \HepProcess{\PW\to\Plepton\Pnu} \ETm with boson recoil is
described in detail in reference \cite{bauer2010modeling}. 
Ntuples containing \HepProcess{\PW\to\Pelectron\Pnu} simulation with the recoil corrected \ETm were
provided from reference \cite{alcaraz2010updated}.

\subsection{{Electroweak} \ETm Shape}
The electroweak background processes that can produce a single isolated
electron which are considered in this analysis are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pelectron\APelectron}, where one of the electrons falls
outside the geometric acceptance or is not detected,
\item \HepProcess{\PZ\to\Ptauon\APtauon}, where one of the taus decays
to an electron and the other decays hadronically, or semi-leptonically and the lepton
is not detected,
\item \HepProcess{\PW\to\Ptau\Pnu}, where the tau decays to an electron,
\item \HepProcess{\Ptop\APtop}, where an electron is produced.
\end{itemize}

The \ETm distributions for the {electroweak} background were obtained from
PYTHIA\cite{pythia} MC simulations for each pseudorapidity/charge bin.  The MC samples used
are summarised in \TableRef{tab:samples36}.  The scale of the {electroweak}
shape is fixed to the signal \ETm shape by the ratio obtained from MC samples.

\subsection{Fit Results}

The results of the extended maximum likelihood fits to each pseudorapidity/charge
bin are shown the appendix in \FigureRef{fig:fit1} and \FigureRef{fig:fit2} and
the $\chi^2$ of each fit is included in \TableRef{tab:chi2}.
%The signal yield in each bin is summarised in \TableRef{tab:sigyield} and 
%The ratio between the fits and the data for each of the 
%bins are shown in \FigureRef{fig:fit1ratio} and \FigureRef{fig:fit2ratio}.

\subsection{Validation of Signal Extraction Method on Simulation}

The signal yield extraction procedure was validated using pseudo-data
experiments. 1000 pseudo-data experiments were generated with the number of
events expected in \unit{36.1}{\invpb} of data. The signal yields are extracted
in each experiment and the asymmetry is calculated. The distribution of
asymmetries is then fitted with a Gaussian.
The measured asymmetry for the 1000 pseudo-data experiments distribution for each
pseudorapidity bin is shown in \FigureRef{fig:toyasym}.

The width of the Gaussian is the statistical uncertainty on the measurement.
The statistical uncertainty can also be estimated from the following formula
\begin{equation}
  \label{tab:statuncert}
\sigma_\mathcal{A} = 
\frac{ 
  2 \times \sqrt{ \left( N^+ \sigma_{N^-} \right)^2 + \left( N^- \sigma_{N^+} \right)^2 } 
}
{ 
  \left( N^{+} + N^{-} \right)^2 
} .
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_\mathcal{A}$ is the statistical uncertainty on the asymmetry
measurement in a given pseudorapidity bin, $N^{\pm}$ is the measured signal
yield in a given pseudorapidity/charge bin and $\sigma_{N^\pm}$ is the
statistical uncertainty on the measured signal yield in each bin.

The uncertainty from \EquationRef{tab:statuncert} evaluated with {MC} truth
values, and the uncertainty measured from pseudo-data experiments for an
integrated luminosity of \unit{36.1}{\invpb} are summarised in
\TableRef{tab:statuncertsum} , and are in good agreement.

\section{Corrections to the Measured Asymmetry}
\label{sec:corrections1}
After the signal extraction procedure the measured asymmetry is simply,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}_{meas} = \frac{
\label{eq:meas}
  N_{meas}^{+} -
  N_{meas}^{-}
}
{
  N_{meas}^{+} +
  N_{meas}^{-}
},
\end{equation}
where $N_{meas}^{+}$ and $N_{meas}^{-}$ are number of positrons and
electrons extracted with the fitting procedure.
To compare with the theoretical value, the measured lepton asymmetry has to be
corrected for three detector effects,
\begin{itemize}
\item charge-dependent reconstruction efficiency,
\item incorrect charge assignment rate,
\item electron energy resolution.
\end{itemize}

If the reconstruction efficiency of electrons is different to that of positrons
then a bias will be introduced into the measured asymmetry, which will need to
be taken into account in the calculation of the asymmetry.  

The second experimental effect is due the incorrect charge assignment of electrons.
The incorrect charge assignment rates, $\omega^+$ and $\omega^-$, are the rate
at which electrons are incorrectly assigned a positive charge and identified as
positrons and the rate that positrons are identified as electrons, respectively.  The
incorrect assignment induces a dilution factor to the asymmetry as a function of
the electron pseudorapidity. 

The true asymmetry at the reconstruction level is defined as,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reco}
\mathcal{A}_{reco} = \frac{
  N_{reco}^{+} -
  N_{reco}^{-}
}
{
  N_{reco}^{+} +
  N_{reco}^{-}
},
\end{equation}
where $N_{reco}^{+}$ and $N_{reco}^{-}$ are the true number of positrons and
electrons with \pT greater than the threshold.  $N_{meas}^{+}$, $N_{meas}^{-}$
and $N_{reco}^{+}$, $N_{reco}^{-}$ are related by the efficiency of electrons
and positrons ($\epsilon^{-}$ and $\epsilon^{+}$) and the incorrect charge
assignment rates ($\omega^{+}$ and $\omega^{-}$),
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:poscor}
  N_{meas}^{+} 
  &= \epsilon^+ \left( ( 1 - \omega^- ) N_{reco}^{+} + \omega^+ N_{reco}^{-} \right)\\
  \label{eq:negcor}
  N_{meas}^{-} 
  &= \epsilon^- \left( ( 1 - \omega^+ ) N_{reco}^{-} + \omega^- N_{reco}^{+} \right).
\end{align}

The Equations (\ref{eq:poscor}) and (\ref{eq:negcor}) can then be inserted
into the definition of the measured asymmetry, \EquationRef{eq:meas}, to obtain,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:meas1}
\mathcal{A}_{meas} = \frac{
  \epsilon^+ ( ( 1 - \omega^- ) N_{reco}^{+} + \omega^+ N_{reco}^{-} ) -
  \epsilon^- ( ( 1 - \omega^+ ) N_{reco}^{-} + \omega^- N_{reco}^{+} )
}
{
  \epsilon^+ ( ( 1 - \omega^- ) N_{reco}^{+} + \omega^+ N_{reco}^{-} ) +
  \epsilon^- ( ( 1 - \omega^+ ) N_{reco}^{-} + \omega^- N_{reco}^{+} )
} .
\end{equation}
The above can be simplified by first assuming that the rate at which
electrons are assigned a positive charge is the same as the rate at which positrons
are assigned a negative charge, \ie\cite{baisini2010electron} 
\begin{equation}
  \omega^{+} = \omega^{-} = \omega ,
\end{equation}
A further simplification is to introduce the relative detection efficiency, $R$,
which is defined as the ratio of electron efficiency to the positron efficiency,

\begin{equation}
 R = \epsilon^+/\epsilon^- ,
\end{equation}
which can be substituted into \EquationRef{eq:meas1},
\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}_{meas} 
&= \frac{
  N_{reco}^{+} (R - \omega(R+1)) -
  N_{reco}^{-} (1 - \omega(R+1))
}
{
  N_{reco}^{+} (R - \omega(R-1)) +
  N_{reco}^{-} (1 + \omega(R-1))
}\\
&= \frac{
  (1+\mathcal{A}_{reco}) (R - \omega(R+1)) -
  (1-\mathcal{A}_{reco}) (1 - \omega(R+1))
}
{
  (1+\mathcal{A}_{reco}) (R - \omega(R+1)) -
  (1-\mathcal{A}_{reco}) (1 + \omega(R-1))
}\\
&= \frac{
  \mathcal{A}_{reco} (R + 1)(1 - 2 \omega) + (R - 1)
}
{
  \mathcal{A}_{reco} (R - 1)(1 - 2 \omega) + (R - 1)
},
\end{align}
which can then be inverted to derive $\mathcal{A}_{reco}$ as a function of the
measured asymmetry ($\mathcal{A}_{meas}$), the relative efficiency ($R$) and the
incorrect charge assignment rate ($\omega$),
\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}_{reco}
&=\frac{1}{1-2\omega}
  \frac{
    \mathcal{A}_{meas} (R + 1) - (R-1)
  }
  {
    (R + 1) - \mathcal{A}_{meas} (R-1)
  }\\
&\approx \frac{1}{1-2\omega}
\left(
  \mathcal{A}_{meas} -
\frac{ (R - 1)(1 - \mathcal{A}_{meas}^{2}) } { 2 }
\right)
\end{align}

The measurements of the parameters $R$ and $\omega$, as well as the
uncertainties, are detailed in the following sections.

The electron energy resolution and energy scale can also introduce a systematic
bias on the asymmetry due to the effect of the transverse momentum cut applied
to the electrons. The largest source of the electron energy scale is the
radiation-induced change to the ECAL crystal transparency.  To correct for this
effect, energy scale and resolution corrections are derived using a \Zee mass
distribution. The results are presented in the following sections.

\subsection{Relative Efficiency}

If the reconstruction efficiency of electrons is different to that of
positrons then the measured asymmetry will be diluted and will need to be
corrected.

The efficiency for electrons and positrons is measured using the tag and probe
method \cite{adam2009tag} with a sample of \Zee events from the same datasets
used in the analysis.  The \Zee events offer a high purity source of unbiased
electrons with which to measure the efficiencies.

From the sample of \Zee events a ``tag'' electron is selected with strict
selection criteria. 
A ``probe'' electron is selected with the same electron selection described
earlier.
The invariant mass of the tag-probe pair is required to be
$\unit{60}{\GeV} < M_{ee} < \unit{120}{\GeV}$ to ensure a high purity sample.

Efficiencies can then be calculated by measuring the signal yield in events
with one tag electron and one probe passing the selection (tag \& pass) and
events where the probe electron fails the selection (tag \& fail).
The signal yield is extracted using a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit to
both the tag \& pass and the tag \& fail samples.

For this analysis the efficiencies are measured in two parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item GSF tracking efficiency, $\epsilon_{GSF}$.
    \item Identification efficiency, including conversion rejection, unanimous
charge assignment and HLT request, $\epsilon_{ID}$.
\end{itemize}
The ratios $R_{GSF} = \nicefrac{\epsilon^{+}_{GSF}}{\epsilon^{-}_{GSF}}$ and
$R_{ID} = \nicefrac{\epsilon^{+}_{ID}}{\epsilon^{-}_{ID}}$ are found and the
overall efficiency ratio is given by $R = R_{GSF} R_{ID}$.
\TableRef{tab:tagprobe} shows the GSF tracking efficiency and identification 
efficiency as a function of the charge.

The main systematic errors on the efficiency measurements are the energy scale
and the signal shape used to extract the signal yield. Fortunately, these
errors will cancel in the calculation of the ratio $R$, such that the
effects of the energy scale and signal shape are negligible
when compared to the statistical uncertainty of the measurement. Only the
statistical uncertainty is therefore propagated to the error in the ratio
$\sigma_R$.

%The value of $R$ is measured in each pseudorapidity bin, as well as inclusively
%across the range $0<| \eta |< 2.4$. 
%The relative efficiency is found to be statistically compatible with 1 so the
%measured asymmetry is not corrected for this effect.

The value of $R$ is measured in the barrel and endcap separately as well as inclusively
across the range $0<| \eta |< 2.4$. 
The relative efficiency is found to be statistically compatible with 1 so the
measured asymmetry is not corrected for this effect.

The statistical errors on the relative efficiency are taken as a source of
systematic uncertainty and is propagated to the asymmetry. The inclusive
electron efficiency ratio is found to be $1.007\pm0.014$.  The systematic error
assigned in each bin is $0.070$. 

\subsection{Incorrect Charge Assignment}

The incorrect charge assignment rate, $\omega$, is the rate at which electrons are
wrongly assigned a positive charge and identified as positrons, and vice versa.
The effect of incorrectly assigning the charge is to dilute the measured
asymmetry.

The main mechanism responsible for the incorrect assignment of charge is the
conversion of bremsstrahlung photons close to the initial track, which the GSF
track reconstruction then incorrectly reconstructs.

The rate of incorrect charge assignment is obtained from \Zee samples, selected from
real data with the same selection as used in the analysis. 
The rate is measured by comparing the
same sign \PZ\ yield (\HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pepm\Pepm}) to the opposite sign \PZ\
yield (\HepProcess{\PZ\to\Pelectron\APelectron}).
It was found that the rate at which electrons are reconstructed as positrons is
the same as the rate of positrons reconstructed as electrons.
The total Z yield from this sample is 6834 opposite-sign \PZ candidates and 21
same-sign \PZ candidates.
The sample is split into 21 sub-samples, representing
combinations of the 6 pseudorapidity bins of the two electrons.

For each \PZ event with two electrons in pseudorapidity bin $i$ and $j$
respectively the probability of an event being same sign or opposite sign can be
written,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chargepdf}
 p(q_i q_j) =
  \begin{cases}
\left( 1-\omega_{i} \right) \left( 1-\omega_{j} \right) + \omega_{i} \omega_{j}
   & \text{if } q_i q_j =-1 \\
\omega_{i} \left( 1-\omega_{j} \right) + \omega_{j} \left( 1-\omega_{i} \right) 
   & \text{if } q_i q_j =+1 \\
  \end{cases} 
,
\end{equation}
where $ \omega_{i},\omega_{j}$ are the incorrect charge assignment rates and $
q_{i},q_{j}$ are the charges of the electrons.

The incorrect charge assignment rates in each of the 6 pseudorapidity bins can then be
determined by a simultaneous fit to each of the 21 sub-samples. The results are
shown in \TableRef{tab:incorrectcharge}. The charge asymmetry is corrected for these
values.
The statistical error on the measurement of $\omega$ is then propagated to the
charge asymmetry as a systematic uncertainty,
$\sigma(\mathcal{A})_{misch}$.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
\toprule

\subsection{Lepton Energy Scale and Resolution}
\label{sec:adhoc}

The energy resolution and scale of the electrons can introduce a systematic
error on the asymmetry due to the effect of the transverse momentum cut applied
to the electrons. The largest source of bias in the electron energy scale is the
changing transparency of the ECAL crystals caused by the changing level of
radiation during the {LHC} 2010 run. Final state radiation (FSR) is considered
as an additional contribution to the electron energy resolution so is corrected for by the following
method. However, this effect is small as most FSR photons will tend to be
collected in the electron supercluster.

To correct for this effect, a set of ad-hoc energy scale and resolution corrections are
derived using a \Zee mass distribution. The corrections are parametrised by
six energy scale factors, $s_i$, and six resolutions, $\sigma_i$, one for each
pseudorapidity bin in the asymmetry measurement.
The scale factors represent the average factor by which the \pT of each {MC} electron
should be corrected to match what is observed in data.
The resolution factors represent the difference between the resolution in data and
{MC}. It is the additional smearing that would need to be applied to
reconstruction level {MC} to match the observed resolution in data.

A sample of \Zee events is  split into 21 categories which correspond to all
combinations of pseudorapidity bins of the two electrons.  A mass template is
obtained in each category from {MC} simulation where the {ECAL} calibration is
taken to be perfect.
A simultaneous fit to the \Zee mass is performed in each of the 21 categories
to determine the six energy scale factors, $s_i$, and the six resolutions, 
$\sigma_i$.

In each category ($category_{ij}$) where one electron is in the $i^{th}$
pseudorapidity bin and the other is in the $j^{th}$ bin, the {MC} template
mass shape is scaled by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{s_i s_j} } $
and smeared by an additional Gaussian with width of
$\sqrt{\sigma_i^2+\sigma_j^2}$.

The bias in the measured charge asymmetry introduced by the
electron energy resolution is evaluated by measuring the difference in the
generator level charge asymmetry and the asymmetry after simulation of the
detector with a perfect ECAL calibration that has been scaled and smeared by the
factors obtained in the fit.

\TableRef{tab:bias} contains the bias values due to the electron resolution for
different electron \PT cuts. 
A conservative uncertainty of $1\%$ is assigned to the electron energy after the
scale corrections \cite{baisini2010electron}.  A systematic error is then
estimated by measuring the difference of the measured charge asymmetry with and
without the additional $1\%$ scale factor.
The systematic error due to the additional scale factors is summarised in
\TableRef{tab:AddScale}.

\section{Other Systematic Effects}
There are several over systematic effects that must be evaluated and taken into
account for the measurements.

Bin-to-bin migrations in pseudorapidity have a negligible effect on the asymmetry
as the position resolution is small when compared to the size of the bins and
the pseudorapidity distributions of electrons and positrons are not steeply
falling in the region of interest, $0<| \eta | < 2.4$.  

The signal extraction procedure may introduce some biases into the measured
asymmetry. A bias may be introduced into the measurement if there is a
difference between the \ETm templates used and the true \ETm distribution.  The
systematic uncertainties due to the signal extraction method are evaluated by
varying the templates used within certain uncertainties. 

\subsection{Signal Extraction Method}

The systematic uncertainty due to the signal extraction method is evaluated be
considering the error introduced by each \ETm template shape used in the fit
separately.

\subsubsection{Background \ETm Shape}

The {QCD} and \gjet \ETm template shape is obtained from a control sample of
events by anti-selecting electrons. This may introduce a systematic bias to the
measurement if there is a difference between the anti-selected {QCD} and \gjet
\ETm samples and the selected {QCD} and \gjet samples.

The systematic uncertainty due to the {QCD} and \gjet \ETm shape is evaluated by
varying the set of cuts in the anti-selection that is used to obtain the control
sample by $\pm10\%$. The effect that this has on the asymmetry is taken
as a measure of the systematic uncertainty.

For each variation on the anti-selection, 500 pseudo-data experiments are
generated using the signal and background \ETm shapes from MC samples with the
number of events that are expected in \unit{36.1}{\invpb} of data. The
distribution of the measured asymmetry in each pseudo-data experiment is then
fitted with a Gaussian.  The effect that changing the anti-selection has on the
mean of the Gaussian is studied, the maximum distance from the asymmetry
measured with the nominal anti-selection is taken as an estimate of the
systematic uncertainty.  The effect of changing the anti-selection used on the
result with real data is also studied.  The assigned systematic error due to the
background is summarised in \TableRef{tab:systQCD} for each pseudorapidity bin.

real data for each $\eta$ bin\cite{baisini2010electron}.}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Signal \ETm Shape from Boson Recoil}

The signal \ETm shape is constructed using information from the boson recoil.
There are three main sources of uncertainty due to the signal template.

The first source of systematic uncertainty is from the uncertainty in the recoil
corrections.  To evaluate the effect of the uncertainties of the recoil method,
the upper and lower limits on the corrections are used to generate different
templates, and the effect on the measured asymmetry is evaluated as a measure of
the systematic uncertainty.

The second source of systematic uncertainty is from the effect the energy scale
has on the recoil corrections.  Any differences in the energy scale of the
electrons between data and {MC} must be taken into account to ensure accurate
\ETm predictions. The {MC} energy scale corrections were determined from \PZ
data and applied to the \PZ MC before calculating the recoil components
\cite{bauer2010modeling}.

The final source of uncertainty is due to the uncertainty of the {PDF} set used
to generate the events that the recoil corrections are applied to.  The recoil
method uses generator level {MC} simulation as an input to the template shape.
To evaluate the effect of the generator used, templates are generated with the
CTEQ 6.6 \cite{lai2010vv} PDF set.  The PDF set contains the central PDF and 44
error PDFs, which contain the \unit{95}{\%} {CL} for each of the 22 free
parameters in the {PDF}.  The maximum changes in the asymmetry with respect to
the central value for each parameter are combined using the prescription in
\SectionRef{sec:asymuncert} and taken as a measure of the systematic
uncertainty.

The systematic uncertainties due to the signal \ETm shape used in the signal
extraction method are summarised in \TableRef{tab:systSIG}.

\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{{Electroweak} \ETm Shape}

The {electroweak} shape is also generated from {MC} samples. During the fitting
procedure, the {electroweak} shape is fixed to the \Wenu signal shape according to
the cross section taken from the {MC} samples. To estimate the effect that the
uncertainty in the cross section has on the asymmetry measurement, the {electroweak}
background is artificially varied by $\pm20\%$ and the effect on the
asymmetry is measured. Even with an overestimation of the uncertainty on the
cross section, the effect on the asymmetry is found to be small.

The systematic uncertainties due to the electroweak \ETm shape used in the signal
extraction method are summarised in \TableRef{tab:systelectroweak}.

\section{Results}
The measurement of the electron charge asymmetry is presented with three
different \pT cuts of 25, 30 and \unit{35}{\GeV}. 
The higher \Pt cuts select a subset of events that will have a pseudorapidity
closest to the \PW boson rapidity and enables the testing of PDF predictions in
a more constrained region of phase space \cite{asym36}.

The results of the electron charge asymmetry with a \pT cut of \unit{25}{\GeV},
\unit{30}{\GeV} and \unit{35}{\GeV} are summarised in \TableRef{tab:results25},
 \TableRef{tab:results30} and \TableRef{tab:results35}.

\FigureRef{fig:asym25}, \FigureRef{fig:asym30} and \FigureRef{fig:asym35} show
a comparison of the experimental results to predictions from
CTEQ10W PDF model \cite{lai2010vv} and MSTW08NNLO PDF model
\cite{martin2009parton}. The predictions are obtained using the
MCFM\cite{campbellmcfm} MC tool and the uncertainties are obtained by using the
prescription outlined in \SectionRef{sec:asymuncert}.

The data suggest the asymmetry has a flatter pseudorapidity dependence than the
PDF models studied. At more central rapidities the CTEQ prediction is favoured
but at higher rapidities the MSTW is favoured by the experimental data.
The combined statistical and systematic uncertainty on the experimental results
is comparable to the PDF uncertainty on the theoretical predictions.
